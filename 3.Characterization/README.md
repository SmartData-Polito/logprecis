# Characterization

This folder contains the characterization files we used to investigate the inference dataset. The characterization uses the predictions obtained with LogPrecis. Refer to `2.Training` if you want to obtain the predictions again.

## Frequent words vs tactics

This notebook reproduces `Figure 8` of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08309). It is the context a bash word "lives" in that determine its prediction (i.e., context matters). This justify the use of attention-based models such as (L)LMs.

## Sessions vs Fingerprints

If we consider the sequences of words' predictions, we can define **fingerprints**. Those fingerprints capture the attackers' targets when attacking a machine, and group together different sessions having the same objectives. The notebooks `Forensic_Analysis.ipynb`, `` studies how many sessions are assigned per fingerprint and the fingerprint's share (how many sessions share the same fingerprint).

## Forensic - Peak Detection - Fingerprint analysis

Examples of how one could leverage the fingerprints to automatize the experts' job while solving tasks such as Forensic analysis, peak detection and sessions' morphing.
